# RhinoCommon Utilities

A lightweight utility library extracted from my development work.

This library provides a collection of **helper methods for RhinoCommon-based plugin development**, including:
- Common RhinoCommon extensions
- Frequently used geometric operations
- Small but practical mathematical utilities

You can think of it as a **thin extension layer on top of RhinoCommon**, focused on reducing boilerplate and speeding up plugin development rather than introducing heavy abstractions.

## Usage

The library is framework-agnostic as long as you are working within **RhinoCommon**.  
Add it as a reference to your plugin project and use the helpers directly where needed.

## Notes

- The code reflects real-world usage from production development.
- APIs are pragmatic and may evolve as needs change.
- No attempt is made to hide RhinoCommon concepts—this library complements them.

## License

Fork it and use it as you like.
